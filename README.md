MPAD2003 Introductory Data Storytelling Project 2
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of service requests in Ottawa, focusing on identifying key community concerns and preferred communication methods with municipal authorities. The analysis utilizes a dataset of 26,845 entries, categorizing service requests by reasons ('REASON') and communication channels ('CHANNEL'). Key findings include the predominance of 'Voice In' as a reporting channel and high frequencies of requests related to 'Solid Waste Collection' and 'Parking Control'. The insights from this study are pivotal for informing municipal policy-making and improving service responsiveness. This README outlines the project's structure, data sources, and the methodologies employed for data analysis and visualization.
